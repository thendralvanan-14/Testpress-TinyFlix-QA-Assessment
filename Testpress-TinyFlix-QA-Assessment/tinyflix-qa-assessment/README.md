# TinyFlix QA Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains the QA assessment for the TinyFlix video streaming platform. The assessment includes bug reports, test plans, automated tests, accessibility evaluation, and performance analysis

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/testpress/tinyflix-qa.git
   cd tinyflix-qa
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

### Running Tests

To run the automated tests:
Need Java and maven installed

```
mvn test
```

## Assessment Approach

### 1. Project Exploration

The assessment began with a thorough exploration of the TinyFlix application codebase. This involved:
- Examining the project structure
- Understanding the component architecture
- Identifying key features and functionality
- Analyzing potential areas of concern

### 2. Bug Identification

A comprehensive code review was conducted to identify bugs and issues in the application. The bugs were categorized by severity:
- Critical: Issues that prevent core functionality from working
- High: Issues that significantly impact user experience
- Medium: Issues that affect functionality but have workarounds
- Low: Minor issues that don't significantly impact functionality

### 3. Test Plan Development

A detailed test plan was created covering:
- Functional testing of all application features
- Non-functional testing (performance, accessibility)
- Edge case testing
- Error handling testing

The test plan includes 40 test cases with detailed steps, expected results, and pass/fail criteria.

### 4. Test Implementation

Automated tests were implemented using:
- Jest for unit and integration testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- jest-axe for accessibility testing

The tests cover:
- Component rendering and functionality
- User interactions
- Error handling
- Accessibility compliance

### 5. Accessibility Evaluation

A thorough accessibility evaluation was conducted against WCAG 2.1 standards, identifying:
- Critical accessibility issues
- Compliance with Level A and AA requirements
- Recommendations for improvement

### 6. Performance Analysis

Performance analysis identified optimization opportunities in:
- Component rendering
- State management
- Resource loading
- Error handling

## Summary of Findings

### Bug Report

11 bugs were identified and documented:
- 3 Critical bugs
- 3 High priority bugs
- 3 Medium priority bugs
- 2 Low priority bugs

Key issues include:
- Non-functional bookmark navigation
- Inadequate error handling
- Missing video source fallback mechanism
- Incorrect duration formatting
- Reply functionality issues
- Accessibility problems

### Accessibility Issues

The accessibility evaluation identified several issues:
- Keyboard navigation problems
- Insufficient ARIA attributes
- Focus management issues
- Color contrast concerns
- Inconsistent error handling

### Performance Issues

Performance analysis revealed optimization opportunities:
- Missing video resource preloading
- Inefficient filtering and sorting
- Missing React component optimization
- Inefficient list rendering
- Lack of code splitting


### Bug Fixes

1. Implement proper bookmark navigation functionality
2. Enhance error handling with recovery options
3. Add video source fallbacks
4. Fix duration formatting in VideoCard component
5. Correct reply functionality in CommentBox component

### Accessibility Improvements

1. Fix keyboard navigation issues
2. Add proper ARIA attributes to form controls
3. Implement focus management
4. Add skip navigation links
5. Standardize error message presentation

### Performance Optimizations

1. Implement video preloading
2. Memoize filtered and sorted results
3. Optimize component rendering with React.memo
4. Implement virtualized lists for comments
5. Add code splitting for large components

## Conclusion

The TinyFlix application provides a solid foundation for a video streaming platform but requires improvements in several areas to ensure a high-quality user experience. By addressing the identified bugs, accessibility issues, and performance concerns, the application can be significantly enhanced for all users.

## Assumptions and Limitations

- The assessment was conducted through code review without direct browser access
- Video content was simulated and not actually loaded
- Performance metrics are based on code analysis rather than runtime measurements
- Accessibility evaluation focused on code-level issues rather than visual design aspects
