## Bug Report #8

### Title
Filter logic for "popular" videos is hardcoded

### Severity
- [ ] Critical
- [ ] High
- [x] Medium
- [ ] Low

### Component
App component

### Environment
- Browser: All browsers
- OS: All operating systems
- Screen Size: All screen sizes
- Device: All devices

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the application
2. Select "Popular" from the filter dropdown

### Expected Behavior
The definition of "popular" should be configurable or based on relative metrics rather than an absolute hardcoded value.

### Actual Behavior
In App.jsx, the filter for "popular" videos is hardcoded to a specific view count:
```javascript
if (filter === 'popular') {
  return matchesSearch && v.viewCount > 2000;
}
```

### Screenshots/Videos
![alt text](image-10.png)

### Additional Context
This hardcoded approach doesn't scale well as the application grows. If most videos eventually exceed 2000 views, the filter becomes meaningless.

### Suggested Fix
Implement a relative popularity metric
